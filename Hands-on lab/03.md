## Exercise 3: Create and Deploy a Keras Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use Keras to construct and train a DNN called the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. LSTM is shown to work well for text classification problems, especially when used in conjunction with word embedding such as GloVe for word vectorization. In this notebook you will also learn how GloVe word embeddings perform on word analogy tasks.

### Task 1: Create a simple Keras based model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `03 Claim Classification`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

   >**Note**: Pay attention to the top of the notebook and check the version of TensorFlow and Keras libraries. TensorFlow version should be == 1.13.1 and Keras version should be == 2.3.1.

### Task 2: Deploy the Keras model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `04 Deploy Classifier Web Service`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

Now, click on the **Next** from lower right corner of your lab guide page to execute the next exercise.
