# Cognitive services and deep learning hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution which combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of various Cognitive Services, with custom AI in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning service. You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will discover how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data, as well as how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning service and Cognitive Services.

## Overview

In this workshop, you will help Contoso Ltd. build a proof of concept that shows how they can build a solution that amplifies the claims processing capabilities of their agents.

## Solution architecture

The high-level architecture of the solution is illustrated in the diagram. The lab is performed within the context of a notebook running within Azure Notebooks. Various notebooks are built to test the integration with the Cognitive Services listed, to train custom ML services, and to integrate the results in a simple user interface that shows the result of processing the claim with all of the AI services involved.

![The High-level architectural solution begins with a Claim, which us submitted for processing using a notebook in Azure Databricks. This notebook coordinates the calls to Computer Vision, Text Analytics, and Containerized Services, which includes a Classification Service and a Summary Service that both processes claim text.](media/image2.jpg 'High-level architectural solution')

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Exercise 1: Locate the Lab Notebooks

Duration: 5 minutes

In this exercise, you will navigate to the folder where all the notebooks for this lab are available.

### Task 1: Open the notebooks folder

1. From within your Azure Machine Learning workspace navigate to the `Compute` section.

2. Select the Compute Instance: **csdl-compute** and then select **Jupyter** open icon, to open Jupyter Notebooks interface.

   ![The Compute section of the Azure Machine Learning workspace showing the Jupyter link selected for the compute instance csdl-compute.](images/06.png 'Open Jupyter Notebooks')

3. Navigate to the `> mcw-csdl > MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning > Hands-on lab > notebooks` folder where you will find all your lab files.

    ![Jupyter notebook interface showing the folder where the lab files are present.](images/09.png 'Jupyter Notebooks Folder')

## Exercise 2: Create and Deploy an Unsupervised Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will create and deploy a web service that uses a pre-trained model to summarize long paragraphs of text.

### Task 1: Install libraries

The notebooks you will run depends on certain Python libraries like Keras, and TensorFlow. The following steps walk you through adding these dependencies.

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `00 init`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Run each cell in the notebook to install the required libraries.

### Task 2: Read through and execute the Summarization notebook

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `01 Summarize`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

### Task 3: Provision the Azure Machine Learning Workspace and Create the Summarization service

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `02 Deploy Summarizer Web Service`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

## Exercise 3: Create and Deploy a Keras Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use Keras to construct and train a DNN called the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. LSTM is shown to work well for text classification problems, especially when used in conjunction with word embedding such as GloVe for word vectorization. In this notebook you will also learn how GloVe word embeddings perform on word analogy tasks.

### Task 1: Create a simple Keras based model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `03 Claim Classification`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

   >**Note**: Pay attention to the top of the notebook and check the version of TensorFlow and Keras libraries. TensorFlow version should be == 1.13.1 and Keras version should be == 2.3.1.

### Task 2: Deploy the Keras model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `04 Deploy Classifier Web Service`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

## Exercise 4: Completing the solution
