## Exercise 2: Create and Deploy an Unsupervised Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will create and deploy a web service that uses a pre-trained model to summarize long paragraphs of text.

### Task 1: Install libraries

The notebooks you will run depends on certain Python libraries like Keras, and TensorFlow. The following steps walk you through adding these dependencies.

1. Navigate to the **> mcw-csdl > MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning > Hands-on lab > notebooks** folder where you will find all the notebooks which are used in the lab.

2. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `00 init`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

3. Run each cell in the notebook to install the required libraries.

### Task 2: Read through and execute the Summarization notebook

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `01 Summarize`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

### Task 3: Provision the Azure Machine Learning Workspace and Create the Summarization service

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `02 Deploy Summarizer Web Service`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.
