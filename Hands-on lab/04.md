## Exercise 4: Completing the solution

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will perform the final integration with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API along with the Azure Machine Learning service you previously deployed to deliver the completed proof of concept solution.

### Task 1: Deploy the Computer Vision API

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal in your browser.

2. Select **Create a resource**.

3. Select **AI + Machine Learning** and then **Computer Vision**.\

4. On the **Create** blade, provide the following:

    - **Name:** Provide a unique name for this instance.

    - **Subscription:** Select your Azure subscription.

    - **Location**: Select a location nearest your other deployed services.

    - **Pricing tier**: Select S1.

    - **Resource group**: Select the existing mcwailab resource group.

### Task 2: Deploy the Text Analytics API

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal in your browser.

2. Select **Create a resource**.

3. Select **AI + Machine Learning** and then **Text Analytics**.

    ![In the New blade, both AI + Cognitive Services and Text Analytics API are selected.](media/image64.png 'New blade')

4. On the **Create** blade, provide the following:

    a. **Name**: Provide a unique name for this instance.

    b. **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.

    c. **Location**: Select a location nearest your other deployed services.

    d. **Pricing tier**: Select S0.

    e. **Resource group**: Select the existing mcw-ai-lab resource group.

    ![The Create blade fields are set to the previously defined settings.](media/image65.png 'Create blade')

5. Select **Create**.

6. When the notification appears that the deployment succeeded, select **Go to resource**.

    ![A Deployment succeeded notification displays.](media/image66.png 'Notification')

7. Select **Quick start** and then copy the value of **Key 1** and **Endpoint** into notepad or something similar as you will need this value later in the lab.

### Task 3: Completing the solution

1.  Return to your Azure Machine Learning compute instance. Within the `notebooks` folder, select the notebook called `05 Cognitive Services`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Follow the steps within the notebook to complete the lab and view the result of combining Cognitive Services with your Azure Machine Learning Services.
