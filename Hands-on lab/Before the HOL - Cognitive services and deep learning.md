# Cognitive services and deep learning before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

 - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

 - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 minutes

### Task 1: Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using the credentials for your Azure subscription.

2. In the upper-left corner of Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

3. Select **AI + Machine Learning, Machine Learning**.

      ![The Create a resource page displays AI + Machine Learning and Machine Learning selected.](images/01.png 'Open Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace')

4. Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use

   - **Resource group**: Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **mcwailab**.
  
   - **Workspace name**: Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. In this example, we use **mcw-csdl**. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others.

   - **Location**: Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.

   - **Workspace edition**: **Basic**. The workspace type (Basic & Enterprise) determines the features to which you’ll have access and pricing. Exercises in this tutorial works on either Basic or Enterprise editions.

5. After you are finished configuring the workspace, select **Review + Create**. Select **Create** after you review the fields you just entered.

    > **Note**: It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud. When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears.

6. To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**.

### Task 2: Create a Compute Instance

1. From within your Azure Machine Learning workspace, select **Compute, Compute instances** in the left navigation and then select **Create new compute instance**.

   ![The Compute section of the Azure Machine Learning workspace showing create new compute instance button selected.](images/04.png 'Create New Compute Instance')

2. Provide the following information and then select **Create**:

    a. Compute name: `csdl-compute`

    b. Virtual machine type: `CPU (Central Processing Unit)`

    c. VM machine size: `Standard_DS3_V2`

   ![The new compute instance form is displayed populated with the aforementioned values. The Create button is highlighted.](images/05.png 'Create New Compute Instance')

   > Note: If the Compute Instance names should be unique within an Azure Region notification appears, choose a different name that is unique to your environment.
  
3. Wait for the Compute Instance to be ready, it will take around 3-5 minutes.

### Task 3: Import the Lab Notebooks

1. Select the Compute Instance: **csdl-compute** and then select **Jupyter** open icon, to open Jupyter Notebooks interface.

   ![The Compute section of the Azure Machine Learning workspace showing the Jupyter link selected for the compute instance csdl-compute.](images/06.png 'Open Jupyter Notebooks')

2. Select **New, Terminal** as shown to open the terminal page.

   ![Jupyter Notebooks interface showing how to open a new terminal window.](images/07.png 'Open Terminal Window')
  
3. Run the following commands in order in the terminal window:

   a. `mkdir mcw-csdl`

   b. `cd mcw-csdl`

   c. `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning.git`

      ![Jupyter terminal window showing aforementioned commands to clone the github repository.](images/08.png 'Import Repository')

   d. Wait for the import to complete.

You should follow all these steps provided before attending the Hands-on lab.
